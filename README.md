Operations on this branch are now ceased. New work will focus on the 3d Vulkan
port of asteroid taking place at the [asteroid-3d branch](https://github.com/zphixon/asteroid/tree/asteroid-3d).
The 2d version will no longer be maintained, and eventually the crate will be
entirely supplanted by the other branch. If you wish to further development on
a 2d version, I welcome you to create your own fork.

~~Very simple game engine built on SDL2. Inspired by kiss3d/ggez.~~

~~Requires SDL2 to be installed/present at build time. Follow instructions
[here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#user-content-requirements) to find
out how to build for your platform.~~
